A simple little thing to install [this custom scoreboard](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2562926750) for [Pavlov VR](https://steamcommunity.com/app/555160) for you

Since the installation is a little annoying why not automate it and also use it for future updates?

## How to setup and use
Subscribe to and download [this ofc](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2562926750)
